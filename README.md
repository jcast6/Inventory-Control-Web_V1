# Inventory-Control-Web_V1

Inventory Control WebV1 is a web based inventory reporting dashboard. This application displays plots based on data from a MySQL database. 
I used the Streamlit Framework with Python to create an interactive and accurate data reporting application.

### Main Inventory Dashboard
Here the user can see the overall inventory, item count and item details. The user can select what year and month the data will be from.

The first bar graph displays the count for the year and month selected. If you hover over each bar in the plot you can see more details about the item. The user can select what items were counted as spools as well.

You can compare item inventory for one or multiple items from different years or the same.(Will add fix to sort years from earliest -> latest -> current)
