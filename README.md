# Inventory-Control-Web_V1

Inventory Control WebV1 is a web based inventory reporting dashboard. This application display plots based on data from a MySQL database named main_items, with a table named items_table. 
I used the Streamlit Framework with Python to create an interactive data reporting application.

### Main Inventory Dashboard
Here the user can see the overall inventory, item count, and inventory distribution. The user can select what year and month the data will be from.

### This table shows the user the overall inventory items with all the details.

### The first bar graph displays the count for the month selected. If you hover over each bar in the plot you can see more details about the item. The user can select what items were counted as spools as well.
